JavaScript: Code Quiz 

This homework assignment challenged myself to build a code quiz from scratch. The application is powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once the user clicks the start button, the timer starts and the first question is displayed. There is a total of 5 questions and the user is given a score of +1 when the correct answer is selected. At the end of the quiz, the user puts their intials within an input and submits their final score within the local storage. This score is then displayed within the highscores page.
